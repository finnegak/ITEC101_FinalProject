                    <h3> My Career </h3>
                    <span>Hardware:</span><br>
                    High performance hardware and work stations are crucial for software engineers'. So they can compile, test, and run resource intensive applications efficiently. <br>Servers are essential for hosting and deploying software applications, especially in the case of web development, cloud computing, and server based applications. <br>
                    <span>Software:</span><br>
                    Software engineers use integrated development environments for writing, debugging, and compiling code efficiently. IDEs provide tools for version control, code navigation, and project management. <br>
                    Software engineers design applications to run on specific operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), and they interact with the underlying OS for resource management and hardware abstraction.
