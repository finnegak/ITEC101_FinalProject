                    <h3> Disruptive Technology </h3>
                    <p> Disruptive technology refers to innovations that significantly alter an existing industry. These
                    technologies often replace established products, or processes, leading to a fundamental shift in
                    the way businesses operate. An example would be 3D printing. 3D printing allows for big advances in
                    very diverse areas: electronic engineering, architecture, and medicine.

                    <h3> Converging Technology </h3>
                    <p> Converging technology refers to the
                    collaboration of different technologies to
                    create new solutions or products. This integration often leads to innovations that go beyond the
                    capabilities of each technology on its own.
                    An example of this would be a smartphone because of various technologies such as mobile
                    communication, computing power, touchscreens, cameras, sensors, and internet connectivity within the phone</p>

                    <h3> Emerging Technology </h3>
                    <p> Emerging technology refers to innovations or advancements in various fields that are in the early
                    stages of development and have the potential to significantly impact industries, society, and daily
                    life. Biotechnology like CRISPR-Cas9 is an emerging technology in biotechnology that enables
                    precise modification of genes. It allows scientists to edit DNA sequences with unprecedented
                    accuracy.</p>
